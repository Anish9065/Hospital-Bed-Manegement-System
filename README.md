Optimization of Hospital Bed Management Using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning + Streamlit Based Decision Support System

📌 Overview

This project presents an intelligent machine learning-based system to optimize hospital bed allocation and patient wait-time prediction.
Using synthetic real-time hospital data, the system predicts:

🛏 Which type of bed a patient requires (ICU, General, Isolation)

⏳ Estimated waiting time before the bed becomes available

The system is deployed through an interactive Streamlit web application, enabling real-time decision-making for hospital administrators.

🚀 Key Features

✔ Random Forest Classifier for Bed Type Prediction

✔ Random Forest Regressor for Wait Time Prediction

✔ Feature engineering to convert raw hospital data into ML-ready features

✔ Real-time visual insights and dashboards

✔ Streamlit-based user-friendly interface

✔ Works on synthetically generated 10,000+ patient records

✔ Supports uploading CSV patient data
